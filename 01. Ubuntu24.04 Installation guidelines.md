## How to copy & paste from Ubuntu VirtualBox guest to Windows host and vice?

To enable copy and paste functionality between an Ubuntu VirtualBox guest and a Windows host, you need to install the VirtualBox Guest Additions on the Ubuntu guest. Here's how you can do it:
**Step-by-Step Instructions**
1.	Update Your System (optional but recommended):
_sudo apt update_

_sudo apt upgrade_
2.	Install Required Packages: You need to install the packages required for building the Guest Additions:
bash
Copy code
_sudo apt install build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)_
3.	Insert the Guest Additions CD Image:
o	In the VirtualBox menu, go to Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD Image...
o	This should mount the CD image automatically. If not, you may need to manually mount it:
_sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom_
4.	Run the Guest Additions Installer:
o	Navigate to the mounted CD:
_cd /media/cdrom_
o	Run the installer script:
_sudo sh VBoxLinuxAdditions.run_
o	Follow the on-screen instructions.
5.	Reboot the Virtual Machine:
_sudo reboot_
6.	Enable Shared Clipboard:
o	After rebooting, go to the VirtualBox menu and navigate to Devices > Shared Clipboard.
o	Select Bidirectional to enable copying and pasting in both directions (host to guest and guest to host).
Troubleshooting Tips
•	Check Guest Additions Installation: If the installation fails, check the log file located in /var/log/vboxadd-setup.log for errors.
•	Reinstall Guest Additions: If you encounter issues, try reinstalling the Guest Additions. Make sure your system is updated, and all necessary packages are installed.
•	VirtualBox Extension Pack: Ensure that the VirtualBox Extension Pack is installed on your host machine. It adds additional functionalities, including improved clipboard sharing.
By following these steps, you should be able to enable copy and paste functionality between your Ubuntu VirtualBox guest and Windows host.
